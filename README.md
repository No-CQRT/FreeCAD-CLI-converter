# FreeCAD-CLI-converter
A really basic BASH script for converting files using FreeCAD via CLI

This script is provided "AS IS"; note: i'm really n00b at scripting.

Just download the script in a directory of your convenience, and chmod as executable.

**tested on linux only, at moment**

Need [FreeCAD](http://wwww.freecad.org) , used in cmdline mode, to work.

**usage: ./FreeCAD_converter.sh inputfile outputfile destinationpath**

Just specify the input/output format in filename (e.g: test_in.step test_out.stl)

Destination file is mandatory, due FreeCAD Bug, if not specified, default (home) path will be used

Enjoy.

Luca
